## Project Wildfire
A web app that displays ongoing wildfires on an interactive map. Users can create accounts, follow specific fires, and receive notifications for updates like growth, containment, or evacuation notices.
- **Features**:
    - Interactive map (e.g., Leaflet.js, Mapbox).
    - Data visualization using GIS data (e.g., fire perimeters, risk zones).
    - User authentication and fire subscription.
    - Real-time alerts via email or SMS.
    - Marked resource locations
	    - Food pantries, public refuge, donation centers centers
	- Fire reporting feature
- **AI**:
	- Provides summaries on the fires, suggested evacuation level, etc.
- **Challenge Level**: Moderate – requires integration with APIs like NASA’s FIRMS or USGS.
- **Potential Impact**: Highly practical for communities in wildfire-prone areas.
## Project Career 
Web app that has information on career paths. Users can create accounts and upload their experience and education. The app then can use AI to determine potential career paths the person could pursue and what it will take to get there.
- **Features**:
    - Real time job board - scraped from other sites.
    - User authentication - users upload their resumes, etc.
    - AI - Provides users with a description of how to enter an industry or career based on current circumstances.
- **Challenge Level**: Moderate – requires AI API and web scrapers.
- **Potential Impact**: Highly practical for job hunting and career development.
## Project Constellation 
Web app that uses NASA information to show the user constellations above their head. Users can track specific constellations and AI can tell the users about the history of a constellation.
- **Features**:
	- NASA API
	- Data visualization of constellation locations
	- User authentication and constellation subscription
	- Alerts via SMS when constellations can be seen. 
- **Challenge Level**: Moderate - Requires NASA API integration.
- **Potential Impact**: Low impact - Doesn't solve a pertinent issue.
