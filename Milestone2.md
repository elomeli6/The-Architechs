- Vision Statement: 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We aim to create a wildfire tracking app. The app would allow users to look up their location and see if there are any wildfires in their vicinity. We aim to help users who might be affected by these wildfires to look up resources, such as evacuation locations, food pantries, how to evacuate guidlines, and perhaps even air quality indicators for those with respiratory problems. Our group chose this idea because of the recent wildfires in California that destroyed large amounts of the LA area and with climate change being a prevalent issue we aimed to bring attention and help to this topic. There are currently a few websites that already exist such as [NIFC](https://www.nifc.gov/fire-information/maps), [AirNow](https://fire.airnow.gov/), [WatchDuty](https://app.watchduty.org/). We believe our project is worth doing as this sort of app can help save lives and two out of the three donâ€™t show a tab for resources, evacuation zones, or wind direction and pressure, which we hope to include in our app as we believe it would be vital information for the user.
