# *Milestone 3*
### *Revised Vision Statement:*
- Our team seeks to create a website that would allow users to track active wildfires. It would allow users to search for their location and display all the wildfires within a certain area. Our aim is to help users who are being affected by these wildfires to be able to look up various resources such as evacuation locations, food pantries, evacuation guidelines, and air quality indicators. Our group chose this idea due to the recent wildfires in California that destroyed a large amount of the LA area. As climate change becomes more prevalent, we aim to bring awareness to this issue. There are currently a few websites that already exist such as [NIFC](https://www.nifc.gov/fire-information/maps), [AirNow](https://fire.airnow.gov/), [WatchDuty](https://app.watchduty.org/) . We believe our project is worth doing because it can be used to help saves lives, and two out of the three links don’t include resources like evacuation zones, or wind direction and pressure, which we hope to implement into our project as we believe it to be vital information to the user.
